        <h3 class="goal-header">My career Goal</h3>
        <p class="goal-text">
            My objective as a frontend developer is to learn all about contemporary JavaScript frameworks in the
             next two years, with a special emphasis on React.js and its community. My goal is to establish a solid
             foundation in the areas of developing dynamic and interactive user interfaces, utilising react hooks for
              state management, investigating the flexibility of hooks, and skillfully integrating popular libraries.
               I also want to improve my UI/UX design abilities by using more complex CSS techniques, investigating UI
                frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Styled Components, and maximising front-end efficiency with tactics 
                like code splitting and slow loading. My ultimate goal is to produce responsive, accessible, 
                and high-performance online apps that match both user expectations and industry standards, while 
                always polishing my skills in frontend development and staying up to date. I aim to achieve this by 
                regeistering and undergoing intensive training via the
                 <a href="https://hng.tech/learn" target="_blank">HNG</a> 11 training cohort.
                  By the end of my training, I hope to build utilable websites like 
                  <a href="https://keyword.org" target="_blank">Keyword</a> and
                   <a href="https://scrapeanyweb.site" target="_blank">scrapeanyweb</a>.
